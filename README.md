Part A: Homework 7 required that we create an short but inclusive and unbiased survey for University of Iowa BAIS students to take. This is a short form that highlights where the students came from, what they have accomplished so far in their time at Iowa, and how they identify themselves amoung the student population (if willing to provide). 

Part B:  My student survey conforms to best practices because of the DEI education and efforts I included to represent all populations of students. For the questions involving gender and race/ethnicity I did my research on how to pose the questions in a positive and inclusive way that welcomed students to answer. Something to note first is that both questions are not required to answer to continue the survey, aiding to the students who would prefer to not address the questions at all. I followed the University of Iowa Climate Survey responses for coming up with the
gender identities I gave users the options of choosing. Since it is a radio button formatted question I also gave users the response of "decline to state". I believe this would be beneficial data to collect, in order to determine what quantity of students would prefer to not answer questions involving gender identity overall. 

For the question involving race and ethnicity, I ultimately decided to leave that question in the text entry format. To encompass the amount of race/ethnicities/national origins of the University of Iowa students could be very difficult to satisfy in a short survey question with listed options or a checklist. Giving the opportunity for students to describe this in their own words is inclusive of every possible race,ethnicity, or possibly national origin. 


Part C: I ensured user accessibility by validating the survey through HTML5, CSS and WCAG 2.1 validators before linking to my Azure Static WebPage. Once on Azure, I made sure it was accessible for all users. I also uploaded by Homework 7 repository to Github. My profile is public and users are able to access the HTML code I used to produce the survey as well as the process I took in doing so. From here, if necessary I could publically share the survey on other platforms for students to access (i.e email, LinkedIn, etc).
